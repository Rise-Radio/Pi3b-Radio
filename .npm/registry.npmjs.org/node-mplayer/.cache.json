node.js wrapper for MPlayer on Linux. Use it to play music on your sound card!\n\n## Usage\n\nFirst, install the module with (assuming you already installed MPlayer)\n\n    npm install node-mplayer\n\nThen, you need to make a new instance of the module. The constructor of the module can take the path of the file to play. \n\n    var Mplayer = require('node-mplayer'); \n    \n    var player1 = new Mplayer('/home/node/Music/Kalimba.mp3');\n    var player2 = new Mplayer('http://mysite.com/myfile.mp3');\n    var player3 = new Mplayer();\n    \n## Available methods\n\n###  play\n\nThis method will play the file defined when the player object was instanciated or setted with `setFile()`. This method MUST be called before any other. \nIt can take in parameter an object that contains the volume, the number of times to play the file (see `setVolume` and `setLoop`) and an array of additionnal arguments to pass to MPlayer.\n\n    player.play();\n    player.play({volume: 50});\n    player.play({volume: 50,\n                loop: 10});\n    player.play({additionnalArgs: ['-ao alsa:device=hw']});\n\n\n### checkPlaying\n\nThis method indicates if the player is currently playing something.\n\n    player.checkPlaying();  //returns true if playing, false if not\n\n### stop\n\nThis method will stop the played file. \n\n    player.stop();\n\n\n### quit\n\nThis Method will close the underlying process\n\n    player.quit();\n    \n### pause\n\nThis one will toggle pause.\n\n    player.pause();\n    \n### mute\n\nThe method to toggle mute\n\n    player.mute();\n    \n### setVolume\n\nThis method is used to set the volume. It takes one parameter, the volume value that can go from 1 to 100.\n\n    player.setVolume(52);    //will set the volume to 52%\n\n### seek\n\nThis method is used to navigate in the playing file. It take one parameter, the seek value in seconds that goes from 0 to the end of the file. This value is absolute.\n\n    player.seek(50);    //will go to 50 seconds\n\n### setLoop\n\nThis will set the number of times to replay the file. The parameter is the number of times, -1 is forever.\n\n    player.setLoop(20);    //will play the file 20 times\n    \n### setSpeed\n\nThis will set the playing speed. It takes one parameter, the speed. 1 is the default speed.\n\n    player.setSpeed(0.5);    //will play the file 0.5x slower\n    player.setSpeed(20);    //will play the file 20x faster\n    \n### setFile\n\nThis one is used to set the file to play. The changes will take effect after calling the `play()` method. It takes the path of the file in parameter.\n\n    player.setFile('/home/node/Music/asdf.mp3');\n\n### getTimeLength\n\nReturns the length of the file in seconds. It needs a callback.\n\n    player.getTimeLength(function(length){\n        console.log(length);\n    });\n\n### getTimePosition\n\nReturns the elapsed play time in seconds. It needs a callback.\n\n    player.getTimePosition(function(elapsedTime){\n        console.log(elapsedTime);\n    });\n\n### getPercentPosition\n\nReturn the elapsed time in percent. It needs a callback.\n\n    player.getPercentPosition(function(elapsedPercent){\n        console.log(elapsedPercent);\n    });\n\n\n### getVolume\n\nReturn the current volume. It needs a callback.\n\n    player.getVolume(function(currentVolume){\n        console.log(currentVolume);\n    });\n\n##Events\n\n### end\n\nThe end event is emitted when the file has ended.\n\n### error\n\nThe error event is emitted when an error has ocurred.\n\n## Stability\n\nThe latest tests of this module were made on Ubuntu 15.10 with MPlayer2 2.0-728-g2c378c7-4build1\n\n## Contributing\n\nAny contribution is welcome!
