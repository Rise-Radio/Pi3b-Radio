Deprecate all the things

> With great modules comes great responsibility; mark things deprecated!

## Install

This module is installed directly using `npm`:

```sh
$ npm install depd
```

This module can also be bundled with systems like
[Browserify](http://browserify.org/) or [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/),
though by default this module will alter it's API to no longer display or
track deprecations.

## API

```js
var deprecate = require('depd')('my-module')
```

This library allows you to display deprecation messages to your users.
This library goes above and beyond with deprecation warnings by
introspection of the call stack (but only the bits that it is interested
in).

Instead of just warning on the first invocation of a deprecated
function and never again, this module will warn on the first invocation
of a deprecated function per unique call site, making it ideal to alert
users of all deprecated uses across the code base, rather than just
whatever happens to execute first.

The deprecation warnings from this module also include the file and line
information for the call into the module that the deprecated function was
in.

**NOTE** this library has a similar interface
