translation.withsmallfuncsets
=============================

* **name:** withsmallfuncsets

* **description:** Represent groups of less funtions than this as indices into
  an array

* **command-line:** --translation-withsmallfuncsets

* **option type:** integer option

* **default:** 0




Represent function sets smaller than this option's value as an integer instead
of a function pointer. A call is then done via a switch on that integer, which
allows inlining etc. Small numbers for this can speed up PyPy (try 5).
