* **name:** gc

* **description:** use module gc

* **command-line:** --withmod-gc

* **command-line for negation:** --withoutmod-gc

* **option type:** boolean option

* **default:** True




Use the 'gc' module. 
This module is expected to be working and is included by default.
Note that since the gc module is highly implementation specific, it contains
only the ``collect`` function in PyPy, which forces a collection when compiled
with the framework or with Boehm.
