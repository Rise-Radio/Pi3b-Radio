objspace.usemodules.struct
==========================

* **name:** struct

* **description:** use module struct

* **command-line:** --withmod-struct

* **command-line for negation:** --withoutmod-struct

* **option type:** boolean option

* **default:** False




Use the built-in 'struct' module.
This module is expected to be working and is included by default.
There is also a pure Python version in lib_pypy which is used
if the built-in is disabled, but it is several orders of magnitude
slower.
