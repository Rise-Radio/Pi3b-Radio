<h1>You want to help with PyPy, now what?<a class="headerlink" href="#you-want-to-help-with-pypy-now-what" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>PyPy is a very large project that has a reputation of being hard to dive into.
Some of this fame is warranted, some of it is purely accidental. There are three
important lessons that everyone willing to contribute should learn:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>PyPy has layers. There are many pieces of architecture that are very well
separated from each other. More about this below, but often the manifestation
of this is that things are at a different layer than you would expect them
to be. For example if you are looking for the JIT implementation, you will
not find it in the implementation of the Python programming language.</li>
<li>Because of the above, we are very serious about Test Driven Development.
It&#8217;s not only what we believe in, but also that PyPy&#8217;s architecture is
working very well with TDD in mind and not so well without it. Often
the development means progressing in an unrelated corner, one unittest
at a time; and then flipping a giant switch, bringing it all together.
(It generally works out of the box.  If it doesn&#8217;t, then we didn&#8217;t
write enough unit tests.)  It&#8217;s worth repeating - PyPy
approach is great if you do TDD, not so great otherwise.</li>
<li>PyPy uses an entirely different set of tools - most of them included
in the PyPy repository. There is no Makefile, nor autoconf. More below</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="architecture">
<h1>Architecture<a class="headerlink" href="#architecture" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>PyPy has layers. The 100 miles view:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first"><a class="reference external" href="coding-guide.html#RPython">RPython</a> is the language in which we write interpreters. Not the entire
PyPy project is written in RPython, only the parts that are compiled in
the translation process. The interesting point is that RPython has no parser,
it&#8217;s compiled from the live python objects, which make it possible to do
all kinds of metaprogramming during import time. In short, Python is a meta
programming language for RPython.</p>
<p>The RPython standard library is to be found in the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">rlib</span></tt> subdirectory.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">The translation toolchain - this is the part that takes care about translating
RPython to flow graphs and then to C. There is more in the <a class="reference external" href="architecture.html">architecture</a>
document written about it.</p>
<p>It lives in the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">rpython</span></tt> directory: <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">flowspace</span></tt>, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">annotator</span></tt>
and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">rtyper</span></tt>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">Python Interpreter and modules</p>
<p>This is in the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pypy</span></tt> directory.  <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pypy/interpreter</span></tt> is a standard
interpreter for Python written in RPython.  The fact that it is
RPython is not apparent at first.  Built-in modules are written in
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pypy/module/*</span></tt>.  Some modules that CPython implements in C are
simply written in pure Python; they are in the top-level <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">lib_pypy</span></tt>
directory.  The standard library of Python (with a few changes to
accomodate PyPy) is in <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">lib-python</span></tt>.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Just-in-Time Compiler (JIT): <a class="reference external" href="jit/index.html">we have a tracing JIT</a> that traces the
interpreter written in RPython, rather than the user program that it
interprets.  As a result it applies to any interpreter, i.e. any
language.  But getting it to work correctly is not trivial: it
requires a small number of precise &#8220;hints&#8221; and possibly some small
refactorings of the interpreter.  The JIT itself also has several
almost-independent parts: the tracer itself in <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">rpython/jit/metainterp</span></tt>, the
optimizer in <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">rpython/jit/metainterp/optimizer</span></tt> that optimizes a list of
residual operations, and the backend in <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">rpython/jit/backend/&lt;machine-name&gt;</span></tt>
that turns it into machine code.  Writing a new backend is a
traditional way to get into the project.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Garbage Collectors (GC): as you can notice if you are used to CPython&#8217;s
C code, there are no <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Py_INCREF/Py_DECREF</span></tt> equivalents in RPython code.
<a class="reference external" href="garbage_collection.html">Garbage collection in PyPy</a> is inserted
during translation.  Moreover, this is not reference counting; it is a real
GC written as more RPython code.  The best one we have so far is in
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">rpython/memory/gc/incminimark.py</span></tt>.</li>
